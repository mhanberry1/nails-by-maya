					My journey in the world of nail art began back in 2013 when I attended beauty school in Tokyo and obtained my certificate.
				</p>
				<p>
					After that, I moved to Hawaii in 2014 and worked in various nail salons, perfecting my skills and gaining experience in the industry. In 2017, I took a leap of faith and opened my own nail salon, where I specialized in creating unique and personalized designes for my clients.
				</p>
				<p>
					But my thirst for adventure and passion for exploring new places led me to Seattle in 2019, where I currently operate my salon out of Ballard. My focus is still on hand-painted art and creating one-of-a-kind designs that reflect the individuality of each of my clients.
				</p>
				<p>
					Thank you for taking the time to learn a little bit about me and my journey in the nail art industry.
