				<h2>What is it?</h2>
				<p>Press-on nails offer an easy, temporary, and damage-free way to enjoy nail art. They are perfect for those who cannot have nails daily but want them for special occasions or for those who like to change their design frequently, within a span of less than two weeks. They can be applied with nail glue or adhesive stickers and easily removed with soap and warm water. Never use super glue directly on your nails, as it might cause damage.</p>

				<h2>How long do these last on nails?</h2>
				<p>It can last from a few days to over 2weeks, depending on what you apply with. If you want them to stay just for a day or two, I would recommend using adhesive stickers.</p>

				<h2>Can I reuse them?</h2>
				<p>Yes, press-on nails last almost permanently with proper care. Please DO NOT use acetone or polish remover!</p>

				<h2>How do I make them last?</h2>
				<p>Please follow the instructions and avoid putting lotion, oil or hand sanitizer to your nails right after or before application.</p>

				<h2>How do I remove it?</h2>
				<p>Simply soak your hand into warm soapy water for a couple minutes and gently peel off or just leave them as long as you like until they pop off on their own. NEVER USE NAIL POLISH REMOVER/ ACETONE because all press ons are made out of soak-off gel, these solvent will ruin it and you will be not able to reuse them.</p>
