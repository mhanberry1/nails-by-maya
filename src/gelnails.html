				Gel Nail (Advice Page) Text on page What is it?
				Gel nails are artificial nail enhancements cured by uv / led light.

				What is Soak-off gel / Soft gel?
				Soak-off gel is flexible and can be soaked off with solvents like acetone.

				What is Hard gel?
				Hard gel is more durable than soft gel, their molecule bond is so strong that they are unable to remove with acetone. Hard gel removal is done by filing.

				What is the difference between Acrylic and Gel?
				Acrylics are nail enhancements made with liquid monomer and powder polymer. They become paste-like texture once you mix those two and then harden in a few minutes. Gel is a liquid resin that is cured by a uv or led lamp. Its main ingredient is oligomer. Unlike regular polish or acrylics, gel never dries without uv/led light.

				What is Dip Nail?
				Dip nail is almost the same as acrylic but instead of liquid monomer, the liquid base is mixed with a product similar to glue.

				Which product is most healthy for nails?
				Every product has pros and cons. Anything could damage your nails easily with improper application or removal.

				How long does gel last?
				With healthy nails, gel will normally last 2-4 weeks. Heavily damaged nails (thin, brittle, or bitten) may not retain the gel as long as they normally would. Although gel nails help strengthen your nails, gel is not invincible. The way you use your hands affects how long the gel lasts on them. For example, opening boxes without using scissors, using fingertips to scratch off stickers, engaging in heavy lifting with long nails, and soaking your hands in water for extended periods (such as swimming or using hot tubs) can often cause lifting and chipping of gel nails.
