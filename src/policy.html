				<h2>CANCELLATION POLICY</h2>
				<p>
					Your appointments are very important, it is reserved especially for you. I understand that sometimes schedule adjustments are necessary; therefore I respectfully request at least <b>24 hours notice</b> for cancellations. Less than 24 hours cancellation will be charged 50% of the reserved service amount. In the event you cancel/miss more than <b>3 consecutive appointments</b> you will not be able to schedule future appointments. This applies even if the cancellation was made before 24 hours.
				</p>
				<h2>LATE ARRIVALS</h2>
				<p>
					Please understand that a late arrival may reduce your service time or may reschedule your appointment for another time and/or day. I cannot guarantee to provide the service you requested if you are late more than 15 minutes.
				</p>
				<h2>NO SHOWS</h2>
				<p>
					No Call/No Show for a confirmed appointment will be subject to charge 100% of reserved service amount. If there was 2 consecutive appointment no shows, you will not be able to schedule future appointments.
				</p>
				<h2>SERVICES</h2>
				<p>
					Nails by Maya only offers "Soak off Gel", and do not offer any service for feet. (No acrylics, No dip)
				</p>
				<p>
					New clients who need a "Fill" or "Repair" will be called and offered an Enhancement Removal and Full Set. If they refuse a new set, they will be denied the appointment. Clients who have Hard Gel or Dip nails must get them removed prior to their appointment. I do not offer removal for Hard Gel or Dip nails. (Nail polish/Soak off gel is ok) I do not provide any artificial nail enhancements on anyone under 18 years old.
